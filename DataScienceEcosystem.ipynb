    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will become familiar with the Data Scientist’s tool kit which includes: Libraries & Packages, Data Sets, Machine Learning Models, Kernels, as well as the various Open source, commercial, Big Data and Cloud-based tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Work with Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, Git, GitHub, and Watson Studio. You will understand what each tool is used for, what programming languages they can execute, their features and limitations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- This course gives plenty of hands-on experience in order to develop skills for working with these Data Science Tools. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Skills Network Labs, you will be able to test each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R, or Scala.  "

    "#### Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Python:** Python is the most widely used language in data science due to its simplicity, versatility, and the vast array of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. R:** R is highly popular in academia and among statisticians for data analysis and visualization, thanks to packages like ggplot2, dplyr, and caret.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. SQL:** SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for querying and managing data stored in relational databases, making it a critical tool for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Java:** Java is used in big data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark. It’s favored for its performance and scalability in large-scale data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Julia:** Julia is gaining popularity in data science for its high performance in numerical and scientific computing, with easy-to-write syntax like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Scala:** Scala is often used in conjunction with Apache Spark for big data processing, offering both object-oriented and functional programming features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. SAS:** SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is widely used in industries like banking and pharmaceuticals for advanced analytics, though it’s less common in open-source communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. MATLAB:** MATLAB is popular in academia and engineering fields for numerical computing, especially for tasks like signal processing and image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. C++:** C++ is used for performance-critical applications in data science, such as implementing algorithms that require optimization and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. JavaScript:** JavaScript is used primarily for data visualization in web development, with libraries like D3.js and Chart.js, making it increasingly relevant for data scientists working with front-end web applications."
